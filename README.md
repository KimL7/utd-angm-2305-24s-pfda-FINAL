## Description
Cat Expression is a clicker game that includes a cat's face. Every time the cat's face is clicked on, a meow sound effect plays, it slightly shakes and a paw stamp is left where the click was made. Additonally, there is a counter above the cat that keeps track of all the clicks the player has made overtime. After the 10th click, the cat's expression changes to something new and by the 40th click, it loops back to the first expression. Lastly, there is a red background with a white fish patthern. I was able to make my project with the help of turtle and pygame. 

Inside the src folder is any image used to create the project. For example, placeholder.gif is the cat's first expression and placeholder4.gif is the last before it loops to the first. paw.gif is the image used for the paw stamp, and meow.mp3 is a sound bite from a Minecraft cat that plays per click.

If there is a few things I could improve, is adding more expressions so that the player is motivated to play past the 40th click. Additonally, I would have changed the mouse cursor to the same paw image used to the stamp so that it looks more polished. Lastly, adding a repatitive moving background would have made the game look less static.
