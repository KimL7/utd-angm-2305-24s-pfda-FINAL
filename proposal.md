## Description
My game proposal is a clicker game, except it's a cat, and the face changes every few clicks. It's relevant to media because clicker games used to be popular during the early 2010s.

## Features
- Cat & Expressions
	- I will have multiple images of a cat that I created. Each will be a unique expression and change through a counter system.
- Sound Effects
	- I want sound effects to play per click. I will execute this through a 3rd party feature called "playsound."  
- Visual Effects
	- There will be a few visual effects that occur per click. I will execute this feature through pygame.

## Challenges
- I'll have to learn how to add pngs, but I might use turtle instead.
- I need to learn how to code sound effects through python.
- I need to learn how to implement extra visual effects.

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
-  The ideal outcome for my project is for a game where you click on a cat's face, and it keeps count of your clicks on the side. Additionally, I want the cat's expression to change depending on how often you've clicked. Lastly, I'd like to implement visual "effects" and sounds that occur when you click on the cat. For example, a sound effect occuring every click or milestone, miniature cats shooting out the main cat per click, background changing colors, and/or the main cat wobbling when clicked on.

Minimal Viable Outcome:
- The bare essentials for a good working outcome is a visual counter on the side and a cat who's expression changes per 10 clicks. Sound effects needed.

## Milestones

- Week 1
  1. Implement cat design.
  2. Implement mouse click counter.

- Week 2
  1. Implement expression changing capabilities.
  2. Add changing backgrounds and cat wobble.

- Week 3 (Final)
  1. Implement sound effects.
  2. Add any extra visual "effects".
  3. Polish and clean code if need be.
